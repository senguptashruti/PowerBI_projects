# Project-1 Wildlife Illegal Trade in India â€“ Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI project explores illegal wildlife trade incidents in India, based on data from the **Wildlife COnservation Society-India (WCS)**.

The dashboard provides insights into:
- Confiscation trends over time
- Types and number of species seized (live/dead)
- Protection status (IUCN, CITES, IWPA)
- Geographical distribution of incidents
- Transport routes and destinations
- Native vs Non-native species

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Preview

You can view a snapshot of the dashboard in the [Pettrade_India.pdf](https://github.com/senguptashruti/PowerBI_projects/blob/main/Pettrade_India.pdf) file included here.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Incidents | 454 |
| Species Count   | 277 |
| Live Confiscated | 1001 |
| Dead Confiscated | 958 |


## Key Features

- **Time Series Analysis** â€“ Incident counts from 2014 to 2024
- **Species Classification** â€“ By group, protection level (IUCN, CITES, WPA)
- **Mapping** â€“ Geolocation of each incident (interactive Bing Map)
- **Filtering** â€“ Native vs Non-native species, location type, and protection status
- **Transport Flow** â€“ Origin-destination mapping of animal movements

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Power BI Desktop  
- Bing Maps integration  
- DAX calculations and filters  
- Public wildlife crime incident data

## Learnings

- Importance of structured visual filters for investigative datasets  
- Visual communication of multi-dimensional data  
- Real-world application of Power BI for policy & enforcement scenarios
